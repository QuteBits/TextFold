		<p>Down inside the computer are three lasers - a red one, a green one, and a blue one. They are powerful enough to make a bright light but not powerful enough to burn through the back of your eyeball and broil your brain, fry your frontals, lase your lobes. <span>As everyone learned in elementary school, these three colors of light can be combined, with different intensities, to produce any color that Hiro's eye is capable of seeing.</span></p>
		
		<p>In this way, <span>a narrow beam of</span> any color can be shot out of the innards of the computer.</p>
